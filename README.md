# HRM Application using Salesforce

## Basic Overview: 

A suitable “Human Resource Management” application was build using salesforce. By using this, HR Management system,
the job applicants were able to apply and view the status of the job application and at the same recruitment team of 
the organisation were able to review and monitor the applications easily.

## Organisation Background:

We have created this HR Management prototype for our organisation using salesforce to minimise the time consumption for evaluating and monitoring job applications as well as to increase the productivity of the work efficiently. Since we follow a two-step evaluation format for job application, our recruitment team consists of both the HR team and Technical Team.

1. Candidates can apply for the job position by filling up the Job Application form.
2. Once the job application is submitted, HR will be notified regarding the new application.
3. After the application has been reviewed by the HR team, they can either approve or reject the application based on their skill set.
4. Based on the HR approval, the job application will be redirected to secondary evaluation, which is also reviewed by Technical Team. 

## Organisation Specific Use-Cases: 

1. Candidates:

    a. Candidates can view the job positions.
    b. Can create, edit and delete the job application.
    c. Can view the status of the application.
2. Employer (HR Team):

    a. Can create, view, edit and delete the job position.
    b. Can view, edit, and evaluate the job application and can either accept or reject the
    job application.
        I. Accepted:
           Sends the job application to the Tech team for review.
        II. Rejected:
            Sends the rejection email to the candidate.
            
3. Employer (Tech Team):

    a. Can create, view, edit and delete the job position.
    b. Can view, edit, and evaluate the job application and can either accept or reject
    the job application.
        I. Accepted:
